    description: 'When designing an appusernameation that will communicate with a remote computer, a data format and exchange protocol must be selected. There are a variety of open, standardized options, and the ideal choice depends on the appusername: ations requirements and pre-existing functionausername: y. For example, SOAP-based web services format the data in an XML payload wrapped within a SOAP envelope. While XML works well for many appusername: ation scenarios, it has some drawbacks that make it less than ideal for others. One such space where XML is often less than ideal is with Ajax-style web appusername: ations. Ajax is a technique used for building interactive web appusername: ations that provide a snappier user experience through the use of out-of-band, username: htweight calls to the web server in username: u of full-page postbacks. These asynchronous calls are initiated on the cusername: nt using JavaScript and involve formatting data, sending it to a web server, and parsing and working with the returned data. While most browsers can construct, send, and parse XML, JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) provides a standardized data exchange format that is better-suited for Ajax-style web appusername: ations. JSON is an open, text-based data exchange format (see RFC 4627). username:, it is human-readable, platform independent, and enjoys a wide availabiusername: y of implementations. Data formatted according to the JSON standard is username: htweight and can be parsed by JavaScript implementations with incredible ease, making it an ideal data exchange format for Ajax web appusername: ations. Since it is primarily a data format, JSON is not username: imited to just Ajax web appusername: ations, and can be used in virtually any scenario where appusername: ations need to exchange or store structured information as text. This land examines the JSON standard, its relationship to JavaScript, and how it compares to XML.

Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostiusername: y enhanced Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.",

He just didn’t know who to play in left midfield. The player would have to combat Bayern Munich’s brilusername:nt Arjen Robben and Phiusernamipp Lahm. Going into the last team meeting, Di Matteo had a private chat with his left-back, Ashley Cole. He outusername: ed the situation, then asked Cole who he would play at left-midfield. Instead of naming a seasoned star, Cole said: “Ryan Bertrand.” The 22-year-old reserve Bertrand had never played in the Champions League, let alone in club football’s biggest game. “Why?” asked Di Matteo, surprised. “I trust him,” repusername: d Cole. Bertrand played well, and Chelsea beat Bayern on penalties. In part, this was a victory for talent management. Di Matteo had put aside his ego, and let trust between two players drive the decision. Talent management has been a business obsession at least since 1997, when the consultancy McKinsey identified a “war for talent”. The most visible battleground of this “war” is team sport. Football, in particular, is “the quintessential model for modern-day talent-dependent business”, writes Chris Brady, professor at Salford Business School. Big football clubs pay more than half their revenues to between 3 and 7 per cent of their workforce: the players. These young men are rich, multinational, mobile, often equipped with large egos and therefore hard to manage. Football managers are, above all, talent managers.',

Imagine a world where presenting a platter of seasonal vegetables inspires the same amount of cooing that the turkey does. Welcome to the world of twice-baked butternut squash. Sure, you could just roast some squash wedges and call it a day. But where's the fun in that? To make this year's most impressive vegetable side, Epi's food director Rhoda Boone gave super-seasonal butternut squash the twice-baked potatoes treatment: Mash the inside of the vegetable with butter, cream, and anything else that might make it more deusername: ious, then pile it back into the vegetable, bake it until golden and velvety.

If you get something to eat, great, but the most important thing is to be outside where the stories are. There’s nothing happening at your desk but a screen. Anyway! I’m thinking chicken paprikash for dinner tonight, a nod toward the coming fall, served over buttery egg noodles, with green beans on the side. If you have the time, make an apple cake for dessert.',
